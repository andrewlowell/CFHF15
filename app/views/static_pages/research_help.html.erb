    <p>The Wilmette Illinois Family History Center will be open during the fair. Volunteers will offer quick introductory tours for first-time visitors. They will also be available to answer questions about Family History Center resources, introduce you to the "My Family Booklet" and offer quick guidance on research, recording stories, and scanning photos.</p>
    <p>Sign-ups for 30-minute computer and microfilm reader slots will begin at 8:00 am on a first-come, first-serve basis, and will continue until all of the slots are filled. We expect the Family History Center resources will be in high demand during the fair and we'd encourage fair participants to learn what the Family History Center offers and then come visit us again!</p>
